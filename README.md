## ✍️ My Diary <a name="my-diary"></a>
* 1st Class
In this first class I learned a lot about CSS and that was where I had my first contact with React. I'm used to work with Angular and what bother me more about this framework was the delay to run, I notice that this do not occur with React.

Well, I can already say that I loved going deeper into the front-end! I'm excited for the next classes!

* 2nd Class
Fist time using node.js as back-end and I'm impressed. It is much easer than I expected and a WAY easer then using C# with .NET. 

I liked the way the database migrations is done. I'm used to work with pure SQL but I think that using typescript is really cool!
