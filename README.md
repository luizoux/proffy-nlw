## ✍️ My Diary <a name="my-diary"></a>
#### 1st Class (August 3, 2020):
> In this first class I learned a lot about CSS and that was where I had my first contact with React. I'm used to work with Angular and what bother me more about this framework > was the delay to run, I notice that this do not occur with React.
>
> Well, I can already say that I loved going deeper into the front-end! I'm excited for the next classes!

#### 2nd Class (August 4, 2020):
> Fist time using node.js as back-end and I'm impressed. It is much easer than I expected and a WAY easer then using C# with .NET. 
>
> I liked the way the database migrations is done. I'm used to work with pure SQL but I think that using typescript is really cool!

#### 3rd Class (August 5, 2020):
> That was intense! The only thing that I don't like is that the "logical" part, like javascript and constants, stay together with the html. It is quit confusing programming like that for me because I'm used to have a html page and a component.ts page like in Angular.
> I'm starting to really like CSS! Maybe my future is on front-end... We will see...
